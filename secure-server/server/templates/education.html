            <h1>How We Secured Our Website</h1>

            <h4>
                We've worked to implement features that address all of the relevant vulnerabilities on the 
                OWASP Top 10, as well as other common web-related attacks. 
            </h4>

            <div class="attacks">
                <h3>Common Web Vulnerabilities:</h3>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Broken Access Controls</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Broken access controls come from a failure to correctly implement authorization, leading to attackers being able to access pages they should not have the privilege to do. This could be by modifying URLs to direct to authenticated pages, forcing a browser to visit them, or by other means.</p>
                    <p>We prevent this by ensuring that any pages intended for logged-in users require a valid session to visit, and only implementing access control policies in a single file (to avoid misconfiguration).</p>
                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Cryptographic Failures</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Leaked data is often the result of cryptographic failures. This category is rather broad, and can come from data being unprotected in tranist, cryptographic secrets being leaked in source files, deprecated algorithms being used, to name a few reasons.</p>
                    <p>Our website requires HTTPS to view, and has a valid certificate to facilitate this. User passwords are hashed and salted with bcrypt, which aligns with modern password storage standards. Secrets are inaccessible to external viewing.</p>
                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Injection Attacks</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Injection attacks take place when user input fields aren't validated or sanitized correctly.</p>
                    <p>We prevent inejctions because none of our URLs are parameterized, and all of our input fields whitelist only particular characters, leaving out opportunities for injection with things like script tags and SQL injections.</p>
                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Security Misconfigurations</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Many languages and libraries have the ability to configure security settings--however, the defaults often aren't the most secure option.</p>
                    <p>All of the standard security headers are enabled for the browser. There are no extraneous files anywhere, nor are there overly informative error messages.</p>
                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Identification and Authentication Failures</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Broken authentication comes from attackers being able to impersonate users.</p>
                    <p>We protect against these vulnerabilities in a number of ways. A user's session will not only get deleted upon logout, but on browser closure, and after 5 minutes of inactivity. Our pas</p>
                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Software and Data Integrity Failures</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Software and data integrity failures come about when the security of third party libraries and the develpment pipeline aren't mandated.</p>
                    <p>Our project is relatively small, therefore integrity of our repository and contributors is easy to maintain. We also ensure that all of our dependencies are up-to-date before we publish the server.</p>
                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Security Logging and Monitoring Failures</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Logs and monitoring are necessary for detecting current attacks and trying to prevent future ones, and many sites don't have these necessary logging capabilities.</p>
                    <p>While we don't have logs stored anywhere presently, an output feed can be seen on our server. Additionally, we monitor for standard attacks (account timeout, rate limiting, DDoS prevention).</p>
                </div>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">10. Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Web applications are vulnerable to SSRF when attackers can cause the server to access pages the end user shouldn't have access to, typically because they require a certain level of access. For example, causing the server to access the user database directly for download.</p>
                    <p>We mitigate this by ensuring that there aren't any possible routes to sensitive files, and by validating any client inputs.</p>
